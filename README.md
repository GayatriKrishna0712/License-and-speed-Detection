# ABOUT THE REPOSITORY
This repository focuses on evaluating real-time traffic videos and identifying license plate numbers and matching vehicle speeds.
For the project: 
1. Software used: Spyder
2. Methodology: YOLOv5 and DeepSort(for vehicle tracking)
3. License Image Dataset: kaagle.com
4. UI software: streamlit

# OBJECTIVE
The objective of the project is to create a UI that will display the speed and number plate of a vehicle.
1. Type of vehicle: For a given input video data, classify the vehicle as car,truck,bus etc
2. Number Plate Detection: To draw a rectangle around the number plate of the vehicle and also display the number 
3. Speed Detection: To detect the speed of the vehicle. 
4. Generate an Excel: The excel should  will record all the obervation.

# METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTION
1. OCR :- 



# BUSINESS POTENTIAL 

# RESULT
Tested my model on real-time traffic videos and recognised numbers from detected number plates. Further I also estimated vehicles speed using distance-time formulae and also classified the vehcile type.
